NOTES
ksqlite is a pckage Brant made to run SQL through python
db_connection established connection to database
SQL - Create, Read, Update, Destroy
Select = read
FROM, WHERE = update
cursor goes to the database and populates the empty fields
SQL is a bitch - be careful about accidentally overwriting files
