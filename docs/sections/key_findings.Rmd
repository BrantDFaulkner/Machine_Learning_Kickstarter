# Key Findings

## `percent_funded`
Non-normal distribution shows that most projects over ~75% of their goal wind up being successful. There may be outside manipulation happening due to Kickstarter promotions of projects that are near their goals, or personal donations by the creators and/or creators personal connections.

```{r echo=FALSE}

df_filtered_by_percent_funded <- df_engr %>%
  filter(!is.na(percent_funded) & percent_funded <= 400)

# Non-normal distribution
df_filtered_by_percent_funded %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = percent_funded)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "#332288")

#Clean up
rm(df_filtered_by_percent_funded)
```
